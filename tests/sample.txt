This is an example showing the snippet processor in action.

// snip: sourceA

Let's now pull in a file that hasn't been committed.

// snip: sourceB

Let's change to see the second tag.

// tag: sourceA-v2.txt
// snip: sourceA

Finally, let's go back to the working copy.

// tag: working-copy
// snip: sourceA

This is the final line of the example.
