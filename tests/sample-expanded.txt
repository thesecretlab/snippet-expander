This is an example showing the snippet processor in action.

// snip: sourceA
[source,swift]
----
This is version 4 of source A. This version of the file is not committed to the test repo.
This line is tagged with both 'sourceA' and 'sourceA-1'.
----

Let's now pull in a file that hasn't been committed.

// snip: sourceB
[source,swift]
----
This file is not committed to the test repo.
----

Let's change to see the second tag.

// tag: sourceA-v2.txt
// snip: sourceA
[source,swift]
----
This is version 2 of source A.
----

Finally, let's go back to the working copy.

// tag: working-copy
// snip: sourceA
[source,swift]
----
This is version 4 of source A. This version of the file is not committed to the test repo.
This line is tagged with both 'sourceA' and 'sourceA-1'.
----

This is the final line of the example.
